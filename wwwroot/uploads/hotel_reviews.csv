10,Hotel Grand Park Inn,"Karol bagh, New Delhi",Jun-23,"Great room, great sense of service",10,"- I felt safe.
- Staff has been pleasantly and quickly responsive before we came at the hotel as much as during the stay. Great sense of service and you get what's shown/told  (which to be honest has been rarely the case in india from my own experience).
- Good location - near the metro and the karol bagh market without being completely in the congested streets (but the area still gets crowded during busy hours of the day making it difficult to even walk around the area which could be a bit overwhelming).
- Rooms : clean and spacious (we took a triple bed room), quiet. There is a lift for heavy luggage and/or staff is happy to help as well to bring your stuff to the room. - there is a separation between the ""showering space"" and the toilets (hallelujah! So you don't have to walk wet feet in the bathroom - this is a detail but luxury point which is pleasant) :) 
- wifi works well
- food facility is there - food is good"

Novotel in my opinion offers everything that other hotels do ,but at best best price as I have had stays in other hotels of aero city as well .
Also the staff is very polite,smiling and helpful.

As we had a day between flights and  planned to stay at the hotel all day and catch up on a few things, the bar area was comfortable with power sockets for charging devices.

167,"Four Points by Sheraton New Delhi, Airport Highway","South West, New Delhi",Apr-23,EXCELLENT....,9,"Myself and my wife stayed at your excellent hotel for one night (24th-25th April).
Our stay was very pleasant, the room and bathroom were clean and smelled fresh.
We had dined at your inhouse restaurant in the evening, (al la carte) the food was exceptional both the veg and non veg.
The waiter ( name I cannot recall) was really good as he went out of his way to serve and answer questions my wife was asking him regarding the menu.
(what he could not answer he went and confirmed with the head chef). 
Next day we had an early morning flight to catch, after checking out we faced difficulties with the arranged taxi, your reception staff
(Mr Himanshu, Mr Vinod and Mr Mayur) were very helpful in assisting us with our transport and calming us with refreshment while we waited.  
Before booking the reservations at your hotel we had already made provisional booking for a hotel at AeroCity, (that being closer to the airport)
After staying at Four Points Sheraton, we WILL be highly recommending all our friends and family to stay here as your staff are your BEST asset.
Looking forward to our next visit to India."

However, on my way to the other restaurant, we saw many spaces unoccupied and hence we were unable to understand the reason for the same. Is it because we were given a discounted rate by the reception staff for breakfast so a different breakfast type was assigned to us, while other guests enjoyed services at Nuke ? That seemed unfair as Nuke offered a large breakfast variety, whereas the other restaurant did not have too many breakfast options."

The hotel's facilities exceeded our expectations. Our room boasted a stunning view of the cityscape, which was especially captivating during sunset and at night. The room service was prompt and efficient, attending to our requests with a courteous and friendly demeanor.
A highlight for us was the complimentary high-speed WiFi, allowing us to stay connected effortlessly. This amenity is often overlooked in many hotels, but Hotel Godwin Deluxe ensured seamless internet access. The breakfast spread was a delightful array of both local and continental choices, giving us the energy we needed to kick-start our day.
The hotel's location was truly a blessing. Its proximity to the railway station eased our travel plans, saving us from the chaos of Delhi's traffic. Despite being close to the station, the hotel's ambiance remained serene and insulated from the outside noise.
Hotel Godwin Deluxe provided us with a wonderful and convenient stay. From the cleanliness and efficiency to the stunning views and complimentary amenities like high-speed WiFi and breakfast, the experience was everything we could have hoped for. We left the hotel well-rested and ready for our onward journey to Jaipur, thanks to the comfort and convenience offered by this establishment."

1687,Hotel Anand Lok Inn,"Mahipalpur, New Delhi",Mar-22,I'm very satisfied. I'd happily stay here again.,8,"This is a review for Hotel Arch, not Anand Lok Inn. When I reached Anand Lok Inn, they said they were placing me in Hotel Arch, which is located about 200 meters away and is probably the same management.
I stayed for a day, then had to leave Delhi and return the next day. When I came back to Delhi I chose to stay at Hotel Arch again.
At Hotel Arch there were mostly pluses, hardly any minuses.
They didn't have a kettle in the room, which is a minus, but one was provided on request, and the staff even offered to put coffee/ tea sachets. I had my own coffee, so I declined, but the offer was there. 
Hot water was nice and hot, worked well. 
The buffet dinner was tasty. 
They have 24 hour room service, which is excellent.
The staff was very polite.
The location is convenient: close to the airport. It's not pretty, but the market is a minute's walk away, which is usually good news.
The room costs very little, so overall the hotel is great value for money."

1838,FabHotel Jasmine Boutique Jasola,"Jasola, New Delhi",May-23,Highly Recommended: Fab Hotel Jasmine,9,"I recently stayed at Fab Hotel Jasmine with my family while my father was undergoing treatment at the nearby Apollo Hospital. I must say that our experience at this hotel was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we arrived, the staff at Fab Hotel Jasmine displayed a level of consideration and genuine care that was truly heartwarming. They went above and beyond to ensure that we felt comfortable, safe, and well taken care of during our stay. Given the stressful circumstances surrounding our visit, their attentiveness made a significant difference and put us at ease.
One aspect that particularly impressed us was the cleanliness of the hotel. The housekeeping staff provided prompt and efficient service each day. It was evident that the hotel maintained high standards of hygiene. 
The buffet breakfast offered at Fab Hotel Jasmine was simply excellent. Furthermore, the hotel's kitchen service was available round the clock, which was incredibly convenient for us, as we often had unpredictable schedules due to hospital visits.
I must also mention the exceptional service provided by the manager, Uday, and his team. Uday's kindness and attentiveness were truly commendable, and his staff followed suit. They consistently went the extra mile to ensure our needs were met and that we were comfortable throughout our stay. Initially, we had booked the hotel for just two days, assuming that we would eventually move to a more affordable option. However, as our stay progressed, we realized that the level of kindness displayed by the hotel staff and the quality of services provided were worth every penny. We decided to extend our stay at Fab Hotel Jasmine without any hesitation.
Our experience at this hotel was truly memorable, and we are grateful for the care we received during our stay."

1971,FabHotel Jasmine Boutique Jasola,"Jasola, New Delhi",May-23,Highly Recommended: Fab Hotel Jasmine,9,"I recently stayed at Fab Hotel Jasmine with my family while my father was undergoing treatment at the nearby Apollo Hospital. I must say that our experience at this hotel was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we arrived, the staff at Fab Hotel Jasmine displayed a level of consideration and genuine care that was truly heartwarming. They went above and beyond to ensure that we felt comfortable, safe, and well taken care of during our stay. Given the stressful circumstances surrounding our visit, their attentiveness made a significant difference and put us at ease.
One aspect that particularly impressed us was the cleanliness of the hotel. The housekeeping staff provided prompt and efficient service each day. It was evident that the hotel maintained high standards of hygiene. 
The buffet breakfast offered at Fab Hotel Jasmine was simply excellent. Furthermore, the hotel's kitchen service was available round the clock, which was incredibly convenient for us, as we often had unpredictable schedules due to hospital visits.
I must also mention the exceptional service provided by the manager, Uday, and his team. Uday's kindness and attentiveness were truly commendable, and his staff followed suit. They consistently went the extra mile to ensure our needs were met and that we were comfortable throughout our stay. Initially, we had booked the hotel for just two days, assuming that we would eventually move to a more affordable option. However, as our stay progressed, we realized that the level of kindness displayed by the hotel staff and the quality of services provided were worth every penny. We decided to extend our stay at Fab Hotel Jasmine without any hesitation.
Our experience at this hotel was truly memorable, and we are grateful for the care we received during our stay."

Afzal, hope I got the name right was a gem. He welcomed us with a heart warming smile. After finishing the formalities of the check-in we were shown our room and we were blown away. We have been to quite a few B&Bs but this was different. The place was tastefully done up with a lovely lounge area on the ground floor and the first floor with a balcony full of lovely plants. Not to forget the superb collection of books.
After freshening up as we had got drenched in the rains we were served freshly made Rice and Dal along with some superb yogurt. We decided to take a Power Nap for an hour and next thing we knew we had dozed off for a good 2.5 hours thanks to the comfort of the room and the noise free surroundings.
Next Day the morning breakfast again was a delight. Hot parathas for the wife and omelette for me along with the toast, fresh fruits and cereals on the side.
We extended our stay by a few hours and when I was not able to get a taxi to go to the airport, Afzal arranged it in a jiffy.
Thank you Team The Neem for this little hidden gem."

After checking in, I was taken thru a back door, into a passage, with a lot of mysterious twists and turns, finally entering another building !!
I was asked to make the payment there at that counter. This counter was of another hotel (Classic, I think) and that opened into the alley behind Hotel International Inn. 
So to that extent I felt cheated. 
The interiors were shoddy. The room was spacious, but with old furniture, TV...slow Wi-Fi. The only thing is favour was the room was clean.
And the food was frightfully expensive!! absolutely 3-4 star rates."

After having tried many times to reach out the hotel, by phone and email (as the payng system didn't work, and they kept answering with auto-response), I went directly there. I arrived and the staff didn't speak English. Thankfully my taxi driver spoke hindi, and I was able to understand that the Hotel did not accept foreigners. But they do not share this information online, neither on their website nor Booking.com. They did not apologize, nor helped me in any way: the person at the reception kept saying ""contact customer care"". So, after reaching the hotel after a long journey (I was coming from Rishikesh), I was without accommodation. 
I can try to understand the policy of not accepting foreign people, but it would be great to have a disclaimer on their website and on any online platform for reservation, as my reservation has been accepted, even providing the number of my passport."

I might have rated the stay as 7 but now its a 4 after this behavior.  
Also, irrespective of the class of the hotel, you expect the bedsheets without strangers hair on it. Getting a mosquito repellant took more than 1 hour and a repeat call. If you want a 10 rating, provide an experience worthy of 10."

3219,Hotel International Inn - Near Delhi Airport,"Mahipalpur, New Delhi",Aug-23,Good,7,"The reception faces the main road and is as shown on your booking.com page. After checking in, I was taken thru a back door, into a passage, with a lot of mysterious twists and turns, finally entering another building !!
I was asked to make the payment there at that counter. This counter was of another hotel (Classic, I think) and that opened into the alley behind Hotel International Inn. 
So to that extent I felt cheated. 
The interiors were shoddy. The room was spacious, but with old furniture, TV...slow Wi-Fi. The only thing is favour was the room was clean.
And the food was frightfully expensive!! absolutely 3-4 star rates."

A standout feature was the efficient and high-speed WiFi, ensuring seamless connectivity throughout our stay. The on-site Café Brownie emerged as our favorite spot for a rejuvenating cup of coffee, offering a cozy ambiance within the hotel premises.
The buffet breakfast spread was impressive, catering to diverse palates and offering a great start to our mornings. The variety and quality of food left us thoroughly satisfied.

After freshening up as we had got drenched in the rains we were served freshly made Rice and Dal along with some superb yogurt. We decided to take a Power Nap for an hour and next thing we knew we had dozed off for a good 2.5 hours thanks to the comfort of the room and the noise free surroundings.
Next Day the morning breakfast again was a delight. Hot parathas for the wife and omelette for me along with the toast, fresh fruits and cereals on the side.

Afzal, hope I got the name right was a gem. He welcomed us with a heart warming smile. After finishing the formalities of the check-in we were shown our room and we were blown away. We have been to quite a few B&Bs but this was different. The place was tastefully done up with a lovely lounge area on the ground floor and the first floor with a balcony full of lovely plants. Not to forget the superb collection of books.
After freshening up as we had got drenched in the rains we were served freshly made Rice and Dal along with some superb yogurt. We decided to take a Power Nap for an hour and next thing we knew we had dozed off for a good 2.5 hours thanks to the comfort of the room and the noise free surroundings.
Next Day the morning breakfast again was a delight. Hot parathas for the wife and omelette for me along with the toast, fresh fruits and cereals on the side.
We extended our stay by a few hours and when I was not able to get a taxi to go to the airport, Afzal arranged it in a jiffy.
Thank you Team The Neem for this little hidden gem."

Afzal, hope I got the name right was a gem. He welcomed us with a heart warming smile. After finishing the formalities of the check-in we were shown our room and we were blown away. We have been to quite a few B&Bs but this was different. The place was tastefully done up with a lovely lounge area on the ground floor and the first floor with a balcony full of lovely plants. Not to forget the superb collection of books.
After freshening up as we had got drenched in the rains we were served freshly made Rice and Dal along with some superb yogurt. We decided to take a Power Nap for an hour and next thing we knew we had dozed off for a good 2.5 hours thanks to the comfort of the room and the noise free surroundings.
Next Day the morning breakfast again was a delight. Hot parathas for the wife and omelette for me along with the toast, fresh fruits and cereals on the side.
We extended our stay by a few hours and when I was not able to get a taxi to go to the airport, Afzal arranged it in a jiffy.

4216,FabHotel Trio Continental Patel Nagar,New Delhi,Apr-23,Free hair In aloo paratha,1," · We booked for this hotel on the basis of good reviews however when we checked in, the story was the other way around. 
First, I don't  like when  staff went inside room without our knowledge, after we checked in and we decided to keep our stuffs inside. We knew upon arrival that there was no toiletries and towels(they should get rooms ready before customers will enter) but when we came back after strolling outside, we found out that someone entered and put inside bathroom. If ever that they needed to add fe things, they should ask permission first if it was okay to enter rooms or not.
Second,our package includes meal for  breakfast but on first day of our stay, we saw hair intact in aloo parantha. When we show it to the room delivery guy, he told that it was by mistake that hair was also added in the recipe.
Third, on second day of our stay, next room door was watching movie in full volume like they were in disco. The facility is not sound proof and we can hear them enjoying around 12pm.
 Fourth, on third day of stay,that was early morning, someone tried to open our door aggressively. We requested to check cctv to know who is acting like that which clearly violated our privacy. Reception staff apologised and told that  this will not happen again. Those people occupying next room will go next day.
I attached picture of aloo parantha with hair and the bathroom glass panes which can give someone in balcony a good peek inside bathroom."

When I booked the hotel, it had another name; when I booked my stay after some days, it changed the word, and now it has another name. When I arrived at the airport and called the given phone number, I was told to call another. I called that number no one answered the call. When I called the old number, the person did not pick up. It is a fraudulent and very doubtful business. I searched the property in and around Aerocity for the next 4 hrs but could not locate the place. My driver told me there is a lot of fraud in Delhi, where one hotel is run under different names. They have one word when booking the hotel and another when you start looking for the place. My booking was a waste and money down the drain. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM BOOKING UNKNOWN BUSINESS HOTELS IN DELHI. This city is full of cheats and frauds. They predate on innocent customers and give bad names to other business owners.

5727,Ashu Villa Guest House,"South Delhi, New Delhi",Aug-23,"Trust Ashu, he will make you feel safe.",7,"the first important thing to say is that Ashu, the owner of the structure, is an incredibly helpful and present person, both by telephone before our arrive and then during the stay (he is not always in the structure, but if needed he arrives in an instant). at the really first contact, he offered us the pickup from the airport but also writing to us very honestly that we could also take a taxi by ourselves, cause is cheaper. I immediately appreciated this sincere approach. And during the days of stay, which were our first days in India and therefore we had various things to organize, he helped us a lot (currency exchange, sim card, etc). Feeling safe at our arrival was priceless. About the room, I can't say that it was very clean, but it was ok: the fan works well, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom decent. My friendly advice to Ashu is to take better care of some aspects (clean surfaces and wardrobes better, fix some mosquito nets, take better care of breakfast) to achieve the high standard he deserves. At that point his hotel will be perfect for the guests. In any case, I can only recommend. Expecially for backpackers as we are it is a good accommodation. Thanks again Ashu."

5739,Wood Castle Grand,"West Delhi, New Delhi",Aug-23,Not at all the standard you would rightfully expect when paying the amount we did.,3,"Hotel absolutely did not meet standards of expectations!! Family of crickets found in bed on day 2. We were moved to a 'premium' room which had dodgy electrics, no hot water and no TV. Due to the poor experience we wanted to leave the hotel one night early and find alternative accommodation but we're informed this was against hotel cancellation policy. The hotel manager was extremely rude and implied we were throwing a fuss as we didn't want to play the full bill. Whilst taken a back by the insinuation I explained that we were asking to check out one night early as we were unhappy with the accommodation, we had not asked for a discount!!! Our room was once again 'upgraded' to a room which had very weak WiFi signal which meant the TV did not work as it needed WiFi. The ceiling fan was wobbling all over the place in the room and the bathroom fan was hanging off the ceiling! Not a good stay at all. I would like some form of compensation give that we asked for a room with a TV and hot water. On one night we had no hot water and on two nights no TV. Not very happy with the stay one little bit!!"

I  was surprised by the cleanliness and think I need to explain: you are in the heart of Delhi and you should love to dive into local life and should not compare apples to oranges. I don't even recall whether the water was cold or hot, but if this is important to you I would recommend one of the artificial luxury islands a bit farer from the action. I also have to admit, that our room was a bit better than the one of our kids, but still ""good enough"". People at the front desk were extremely nice and helpful (I love that giant book where all guest information is registered manually with all that paper based transactions - impressive). We had a room with window and I first feared the noise from the bazar below which actually was no issue at all and I would recommend it.

As it was our first time in Delhi, he went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and provided us loads recommendations of what to do in the city. Eleven is a great place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city but still a short distance from some famous monuments (i.e. Humayuns Tomb). I would not stay anywhere else next time I'm here. Do yourself a favor and stay here instead of a hotel - you will never get this kind of thoughtfulness and consideration at a hotel stay!"

There were full of bottles of water in the room when we arrived. The location is very quiet (it's rare in this city) and easy to find. The owner was very nice and responded quickly. Indian beakfast was good (but a bit more spicy could be great). We stayed only 1 night, but if we want to stay again in Delhi, we won't hesitate to book again in this B&B."

The room is very spacious, clean and quiet, the bed is comfortable. Breakfast is very good. Communication with the host Ajay is easy and quick. Ajay is very kind, welcoming and honest. There was an overbooking problem with our reservation, which was dealt with by Ajay very efficiently and professionally. Ajay offered us one night for free in a neighboring guesthouse of the same standard as his place, and in addition he dropped us off at the train station in the morning. I have no hesitation in recommending this place for a stay in Delhi."

6267,Flagship Silver Stays,"South Delhi, New Delhi",Nov-22,Scammers. Hotel doesnt exist.,1,This hotel doesnt exists its a big scam. The hotel Flagship Silver stay doesnt exisit I have also compalined to OYO to delist this hotel as it doesnt exisit. When you try to contact the hotel through booking. Com app they wont answer and when they answer they ask for your number.  Then another guy calls up and says I am sending you the location.  P. S when you go to the location there are no hoarding of the hotel or the hotel doesnt exisit. They guy who sent you the location isbof another OYO hotel named comfort stay. They wont accept your booking and charge you double. Booking. Com is a reputed brand and by listing such 3rd class hotels for cheap is damaging the brand value and wont trust booking. Com for listing such inferior and scammed hotels. I didnt sleep for 16 hrs and then it took me 3 hrs to find the hotel ( which doesnt exist and to go to thier other 3rd class hotel) I ended up complaing to OYO and didnt check in.  My humble request to booking. Com if you cant take legal action against such scammers atleast delist them both from your platform.

The hotel on the second floor with no elevator and least they could have done is to help us with our luggage but no. There is no guard safety and around 2 in the night you can hear people screaming outside your room on the corridor. And washroom with no hand wash , soap and all in all no cleanliness.

They did their very best to answer to my few requests. We were expecting a renewed hotel as it is mentioned on the website but arrived in a ""work in progress"" hotel. For sure the part already done is really beautifully realised, the materials, the style, everything has been thought. Sadly, no gym, no nice outdoor seatings and the felling to be in the middle of renovation is not the best. I would love to go there again but need to be sure the work is done and not in progress anymore.
By the way, the breakfast area and food are really high level and anyone of the staff is nicely friendly and very helpful."

Offering a respite from the crowds, Friends' Colony is a quiet green part of the city but not too far from Connaught Place and Khan Market for example.
The hotel itself is beautiful. I am a modernist at heart so was bound to love the building, that it is spotless and the staff incredibly helpful only add to the quality of a stay here.  I had some issues with my room (just the kind anyone can experience anywhere in the world, low shower pressure for a while and drop in internet) but was given a new room really speedily.

6961,FabHotel Trio Continental Patel Nagar,New Delhi,Apr-23,Free hair In aloo paratha,1," · We booked for this hotel on the basis of good reviews however when we checked in, the story was the other way around. 
First, I don't  like when  staff went inside room without our knowledge, after we checked in and we decided to keep our stuffs inside. We knew upon arrival that there was no toiletries and towels(they should get rooms ready before customers will enter) but when we came back after strolling outside, we found out that someone entered and put inside bathroom. If ever that they needed to add fe things, they should ask permission first if it was okay to enter rooms or not.
Second,our package includes meal for  breakfast but on first day of our stay, we saw hair intact in aloo parantha. When we show it to the room delivery guy, he told that it was by mistake that hair was also added in the recipe.
Third, on second day of our stay, next room door was watching movie in full volume like they were in disco. The facility is not sound proof and we can hear them enjoying around 12pm.
 Fourth, on third day of stay,that was early morning, someone tried to open our door aggressively. We requested to check cctv to know who is acting like that which clearly violated our privacy. Reception staff apologised and told that  this will not happen again. Those people occupying next room will go next day.
I attached picture of aloo parantha with hair and the bathroom glass panes which can give someone in balcony a good peek inside bathroom."
